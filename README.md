Random collection of code related to Quik and QLua. My stuff from end of 2013 experiments and some libraries from internet

* QuikSharp is Lua - .NET connector
* QuikStarter is a utility to make Quik always running and reconnecting (probably taken from Stock#. Not needed since built-in reconnect is quite reliable. It is better to make SMS/Email notification if something unexpected happens)

/lib folder contains Lua code for QuikSharp and publicly available C# Trans2Quik wrapper and DDE libraries
